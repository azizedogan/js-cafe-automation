# Cafe Automation with Javascript

This project is designed for a caf√© where customers can click on their table number, select items from a menu, and add them to an order list. Once the ordering process is complete, the total price is displayed at the table.

There is also a page displaying all the items on the menu and another page where new items can be added.

This project was created to enhance my JavaScript skills.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `json-server --watch db.json`

To run the db.json file.
Open [http://localhost:3000/menu](http://localhost:3000/menu) to view it in your browser.

Then you can run it with Live Server.
